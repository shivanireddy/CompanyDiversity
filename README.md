# Company Diversity
Submission for ShellHacks2020..

## Project Overview

Company Diversity is a chrome extension that displays information about the company whose website you are on. Specifically,
the pop-up window will return two pie charts for gender and ethnic diversity, as well as recent controversial news related to the employer.

I chose to build this project to make company diversity information more accessible. An organization's employee makeup is an important consideration for job-seekers, especially those in minority groups.
I also hope that by making this information easier to access, companies will become more self-aware of their workforce demographic.

The data we are using is from Information is Beautiful's [Diversity in Tech dataset](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/).

## Using the Extension

To use the extension, git clone the repo, and "Load unpacked" on the Chrome Extension page in Developer Mode. From there, you can simply click the extension icon in the tool bar when you are browsing the webpage of a company you're interested in.
