# Know Your Company
Submission for TechTogether 2019. Won Spark's Best Inclusion in Tech Hack and TechTogether's Best Gender Equality Hack. Devpost submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/know_your_company).

## Project Overview

Know Your Company is a chrome extension that displays information about the company whose website you are on. Specifically,
the pop-up window will return two pie charts for gender and ethnic diversity, as well as recent controversial news related to the employer.

This project was built by @raphaelletseng, @miyakeilin, @gohsu, and @cclin130 at TechTogether Boston 2019. We chose to build this project to make company diversity
information more accessible. An organization's employee makeup is an important consideration for job-seekers, especially those in minority groups.
We also hope that by making this information easier to access, companies will become more self-aware of their workforce demographic.

The data we are using is from Information is Beautiful's [Diversity in Tech dataset](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/).

## Using the Extension

To use the extension, git clone the repo, and "Load unpacked" on the Chrome Extension page in Developer Mode. From there, you can simply click the extension icon in the tool bar when you are browsing the webpage of a company you're interested in.
